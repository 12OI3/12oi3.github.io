## Why Choosing Game Developer?

Ever since I started playing video games in high school, I’ve been amazed by how games can offer players various experiences. This inspired me to pursue a career in game development, and I’ve been playing and creating games ever since (mostly Unity & C#).

## Years of Learning and Creating Games

I have years of experience developing small-scale game projects and a great passion for creating games. In the various game projects I’ve worked on, I’ve not only served as a game programmer but also taken on roles such as game designer and project manager. Along with these experience, I’ve developed strong collaboration skills and independence as a developer.

## Future Plans

I’m currently developing my own indie game and learning Godot. In the future, I will continue to create more and more games. Feel free to [contact](mailto:benbook90@gmail.com) me if you want to tell me something or just chat with me. I am welcome to all game development inquiries and offers.
