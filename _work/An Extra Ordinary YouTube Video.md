An Extraordinary YouTube Video is a bullet hell action game created during the CS 241002 at National Tsing Hua University, using the Cocos engine to develop a web-based game. Our concept was inspired by the idea of tricking players into believing they were watching an impressive YouTube gameplay video, only to realize it was someone actually playing live, with the YouTube interface being a clever fake.

We chose the bullet hell genre for its visual appeal and intensity, allowing us to design a game with strong ornamental value. The game features three distinct stages, each with its own unique style. Players can dodge and attack while accumulating gauges that power an ultimate ability. The more aggressively you play, the higher your score will be when the boss is defeated within a set time.

In addition to using the ultimate to deal damage, players can also rewind time. At any point in a stage, you can use gauges to create a save point and return to it whenever needed. This feature lets players retry challenging segments, refining their performance to maximize their score.

The game also includes a global ranking system, allowing players to compete for the highest scores with others around the world.
