Picking up a real sword is a nearly impossible dream for most players, let alone using it to defeat enemies and save the world. While kendo exists in real life, its entry barrier is relatively high compared to other sports, making it difficult for most people to spar with others in reality. For most, it’s an experience they won’t easily have. That’s why we’ve created a VR kendo action game, designed to offer three different types of players a unique experience: those who want to feel the joy of trying kendo for the first time, those who crave the thrill of slicing through enemies without hesitation, and those who wish to train kendo through the game.

You Ken-Do It is a VR kendo game centered around a Block & Counter mechanic. When you encounter an enemy, they will attack from various directions and in different order, requiring you to adjust your controller to perfectly parry each attack with precise timing. As your opponent tires, they will eventually launch a special attack that you need to catch. By releasing and pushing back at just the right moment, you can expose the enemy’s weak point, allowing you to stun them.

One of the game’s standout features is our recreation of the slashing system from Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance in VR. After stunning your enemy, you can freely slash them, and your final score being determined by your performance during the game and how many pieces you’ve sliced them into. The game also highlights which aspects of your skills need improvement, helping you identify your weak points.
