## Description

《Duplicate Solution Unacceptable》is a mini puzzle game that was created during GMTK Jam 2023, with the theme of "Built to Scale." In the game, you have to use the arrow key to fill the 5 X 5 board. Remember, duplicate solutions are unacceptable, and the difficulty will build up as long as you keep playing. 

This is my first time trying Godot, and I have been quite busy recently so I haven't had much time to prepare this game jam and learn the engine. I actually start this project on the last day of the Jam, but still, I got some ideas while messing up with Godot, which is a really fun experience.
