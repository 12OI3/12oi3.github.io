## Description

Deal Da Time is a mini puzzle game that was created during GMTK Jam 2023, with the theme of "Role Reversed."

In our game, you need to adjust the timer to help a stupid little bot reach the goal. Since this bot only takes action based on the time, you have to speed up or slow down the timer to achieve perfect timing.

At the start of each level, you will have several blocks. A yellow block means the timer will double in speed, while an orange block means the timer will run at half speed. After placing all the blocks on the action bar, you can click the machine to see how the bot executes its actions. If the bot reaches the diamond, you win.

This game offers an intriguing gameplay concept where players must adjust the timer to control the bot's movements. Analyzing the bot's actions and strategically placing the blocks will be key to achieving success in the puzzles.
