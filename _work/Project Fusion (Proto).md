## Description

Project Fusion is a unique turn-based boss rush combat game featuring a special order timeline mechanic and an artifact fusion system. In this game, you'll need to assemble a party of mages for each mission to face powerful bosses. You can freely create and fuse various artifacts, granting additional skills to each party member. During battle, careful planning is crucial—strategically using your skills each turn will help you gain the most advantageous position on the order timeline. By utilizing the Expose and Break systems, you can combo your enemies and maximize your damage output.

The game features many unique mechanics. Feel free to check out [this page](https://intoxicat-studio.itch.io/project-fusion/devlog/632943/project-fusion-devlog-1-reveal-and-introduce-ench) for more details.

Unfortunately, the demo didn’t meet our expectations, so we decided to rework the entire game. In the future, we will show our new Project Fusion eventually, allowing players worldwide to fuse artifacts freely and create the ultimate party of their own!
