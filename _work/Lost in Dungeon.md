## Description

This game is about getting lost in a dungeon due to your addiction to collecting more items, just like everyone does when playing Diablo-like games. You need to try to find your way out.

The theme of the game jam is "Lost and Found," and we interpret "lost" as both being lost in the maze and losing your items. You will "find" various items in this game, but only by actively losing all your items can you "find" your way out of where you were "lost".
