Survivor For The Feast is a survivor-like game developed using Unity during the CS 550300 at National Tsing Hua University. This unique game combines survivor like with cooking. As a chef, your goal is to hunt for rare ingredients and sell them for a large profit. Players explore various biomes, defeat mobs, collect ingredients, and combine those ingredients based on their properties to create dishes that grant skills and strengthen the player. You must defeat the final boss to obtain the ultimate rare ingredient.

At the start of the game, players choose from three different job classes. There are six distinct biomes, each with unique mobs that drop different ingredients. While players can move and perform basic attacks, a special attack is required to land the killing blow on mobs for ingredients to drop. During exploration, players earn exploration points by defeating mobs or completing missions. After fully exploration the level, a boss spawns, and defeating it is required to progress to the next stage. Since mobs grow stronger over time, itâ€™s essential not to stay too long in one area.

Players can find campfires on the map, which are the places where cooking is available. Each ingredient has unique properties, and combining them can create dishes. These dishes represent skills, and stacking dishes strengthens those skills. There are 144 dishes in total, and with various weapon upgrades and status effect stacks, players can become unstoppable. Special dishes can only be created with rare ingredient combinations, unlocking the ultimate ability.

This game was developed by a team of five over four months and stands as one of the largest projects I've ever worked on. It won the Best Game Design award at the Taiwan Student Innovation Game Design Competition and Best Game in the Game Development Course at National Tsing Hua University.
