I love detective fiction—Agatha Christie, Sherlock Holmes, Father Brown, Kotenbu, and so on. I’ve also played many detective games-Her Story, Return of the Obra Dinn, Ghost Trick and Disco Elysium. In my opinion, a perfect detective game has never existed, and it never will.

## Perfect detective game never exist. Never ever ever ever, baby!

I believe a perfect detective game requires two essential elements: a perfect detective story and a perfect detective gameplay. However, these two elements are like parallel lines—they will never intersect. For instance, Ghost Trick features one of the best detective stories with its mind-blowing, surprising plot, but the gameplay leaves much to be desired. On the other hand, Return of the Obra Dinn excels in gameplay, delivering one of the most immersive detective experiences, but its story lacks lasting impact. In fact, as I write this, I can barely recall Obra Dinn’s plot, only the incredible gameplay that stood out.

Why can’t a game have both elements at once? The answer is simple.

## We are not detectives

A perfect detective story typically revolves around a genius protagonist who uncovers minor details, spots contradictions, and pieces together the mystery. By the end, this character reveals who did it, how it was done, and why. Writing such a story may be difficult, but not impossible.

However, aligning this kind of narrative with gameplay is a different challenge entirely.

A perfect detective gameplay experience would allow the player complete freedom to explore the crime scene, gather clues, and solve the case independently. But here’s the problem: we, as players, are not detectives. Expecting us to solve crimes like Sherlock Holmes is unrealistic. But at the same time, receiving too much guidance from the game can make it feel like we’re not truly playing. Danganronpa, for example, forces players to gather specify clues, limiting our freedom and turning the gameplay to be constrained. Detective games need to offer hints to help players progress, but without making us feel like we’re just following a script.

In essence, the key to the "closest-to-perfect" detective game lies in striking the right balance between story and gameplay. The tricky part is crafting a plot that still surprises the player while subtly guiding them toward solving the crime without feeling too directed.

## Disco Elysium: not Perfect, but the closest I’ve played

In Disco Elysium, the answer lies in its CRPG framework. In the game, you role-play as a detective who’s lost his money, equipment, and even his memory. Starting with a blank slate, players are free to define what kind of detective they want to be. The game offers four core attributes, 24 skills, and a host of passive abilities (called thoughts), allowing for diverse playstyles. This flexibility plants the idea in the player's mind: I am the one detecting.

The structure of Disco Elysium is brilliant. It hints at how to progress through the story in a way that never feels forced. Similar to the movie Inside Out, the game’s 24 skills represent different facets of your personality, constantly offering suggestions. For example, when you find drugs, Electrochemistry might urge you to consume them, while Volition tries to stop you. These voices guide you through the game without feeling intrusive, giving players the freedom to decide which actions to take. By disguising hints as inner thoughts, Disco Elysium successfully immerses players in the role of a detective while keeping them on track.

From a gameplay perspective, this approach is genius. Players can explore the game freely while still being subtly guided toward their next steps.

## And what about the story

The story in Disco Elysium isn’t perfect, but it’s good—really good. I enjoyed the process of piecing together clues, forming hypotheses, and then encountering contradictions that forced me to rethink everything. The developers likely realized that they couldn’t create a flawless detective story for players to solve, so they layered additional elements into the narrative. Philosophical, political, and social discussions abound, with various characters reflecting on the world they inhabit. This adds richness to the experience, elevating the story beyond just a detective narrative.

While Disco Elysium can be complex and difficult to grasp fully, I’m planning a second playthrough to dig deeper into its intricate world. With its CRPG format, the game encourages repeat playthroughs, and I’m eager to uncover even more of the story’s depths as a detective.
