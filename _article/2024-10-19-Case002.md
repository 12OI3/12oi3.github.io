Border Pioneer is an interesting deck-building tower defense strategy game. You draw cards and resources each round, and building your kingdom requires careful use of both. It’s really fun to discover different defense options that can create unique synergies, and the cards and skills you choose will significantly impact your playstyle in each level. Although I’ve only played a little, the game can scale up to massive waves of enemies, which could make for an exciting challenge.

Fxxk this game. First of all, the game is fun. The pixel art style definitely catches my eyes, but the gameplay itself is just a standard deduction game. However, I absolutely loved one particular section where you have to surf the internet to uncover hidden information. You start with a thread on a related topic and then use key words you find to search for other threads—much like how the game Her Story worked. I was really impressed by this system because it mirrors exactly how I search for information in real life, and I have a good time during this puzzle section.
But then, the demo stops right before revealing the truth, so fxxk this game.

## Star Vaders

A roguelike deck builder recommended by a friend, this game gives me major Into the Breach vibes. You have to defend against waves of enemies using your deck and cards. The overheat mechanic stands out from the typical energy system used in most deck builders. It allows you to play an additional card per turn, but at the cost of disabling the rest of your cards. Overheat can be incredibly powerful in certain situations, but overusing it fills your deck with unusable cards. Should I overheat this turn or take a bit of damage? The decision-making in each turn is so much fun.

## Sultan’s Game

Sultan’s Game pulls players right into the action from the start. In the tutorial, you play as King Sultan, who decides to engage in a crucial game purely for fun, and players are forced to kill numerous people in the palace. After the tutorial, the real protagonist is assigned to play the same game by Sultan’s orders, and the game officially begins. The gameplay revolves around making decisions during various events, with the goal of satisfying your king. As you progress, you’ll face more dilemmas and uncover mysterious stories unfolding in the kingdom. The concept and art style are both compelling, though the game could be better by the improvements to the user interface, especially in helping players better understand the events and their consequences.
