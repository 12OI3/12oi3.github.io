I am quite disappointed with Metaphor: ReFantazio.

But make no mistake, the game is fun (of course it is, as it literally uses 90% of the mechanics from Shin Megami Tensei and the Persona series). The music is awesome, the combat is intense, and the job system is creative. Despite some issues with UI/UX and optimization (such as occasional frame drops and inexplicable pauses), the game itself is still, overall, a good experience.

However, the story—arguably one of the most important elements in a RPG—just falls flat.

## Fantasy is not dead, but logic in the story is.

At first glance, watching a fantasy world go through an election might seem intriguing, but the game is full of illogical plot points. For instance, in the demo story, you and two other characters are tasked with assassinating Louis Guiabern, a royal army officer considered to be the strongest character in the game. Seriously, who gave them the confidence to attempt such a mission? The plan is simply "You guys go distract Louis by shouting to him, and I'll find a chance to kill him." How could anyone believe this would actually work? These kinds of absurd decisions made by the characters keep happening throughout the entire game. During my playthrough, I couldn't help but criticize these moments, which prevented me from fully immersing myself in the story.

## Unclear motivations alienate the player

In most JRPGs, developers expect the player to identify with the protagonist, which is why some JRPG stories can be so memorable. However, in Metaphor: ReFantazio, the player's goals are constantly dictated by the plot, leaving little room for resonance. This issue is most apparent in the early stages, where player motivation is largely driven by the unfolding story. I found myself confused numerous times, unable to share the emotions the protagonist experiences. A great JRPG story need to let players feel motivated on their own, thus enable players have a deeper connection with the protagonist. I just don't have such connection with Metaphor: ReFantazio's protagonist. Eventually, The game returns to a more traditional fantasy narrative in the latter half, which alleviates this problem somewhat. However, the election plot from earlier feels almost like a joke by that point.

## Play other Atlus games, then Metaphor: ReFantazio

I consider myself a big fan of the Persona series, with 300 hours in Persona 5 Royal, along with playing Persona 4 Golden, Persona 3 Reload, and other Persona-related titles. As mentioned, Metaphor: ReFantazio borrows heavily from the mechanics of both Shin Megami Tensei and Persona, so it’s impossible for me not to compare them. While it is a good game (not great, but not bad either), the gameplay isn’t as impressive as P5R, the story doesn’t leave as strong an impact as P3R, and the character development isn’t as memorable as P4G. Therefore, I’d only recommend Metaphor if you’ve already played those standout games from Atlus. It might be a good RPG, but the game just doesn't hit me.
