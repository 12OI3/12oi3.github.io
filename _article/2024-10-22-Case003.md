Dreamy.

Yes, "dreamy" is the most accurate word to describe this game. Sayonara Wild Hearts is not just an action rhythm game; it's also a music album. In just an hour of gameplay, I experienced one of the best combinations of music, visual and gameplay. Music is the heart of the game, and each level brings a different track, a different map, different gameplay, and a unique experience.

## Sayonara to the reality, and diving into the world of dream

There isn't a single core mechanic in Sayonara Wild Hearts. Sometimes you're surfing on arcane cards, sometimes driving a fancy motorbike, and other times engaging in epic fights against enemy. Throughout the game, new mechanics are constantly introduced, and the levels become more varied - just like dreaming. What's notable is that the game's controls are simple, allowing the player to fully immerse themselves in the experience. The player only needs to control the character's direction and press one button, letting themself become fully absorbed in the dreamlike world of Sayonara Wild Hearts. It's truly impressive how the developers managed to create such varied gameplay with just a basic input system.

## Should the narrative exist or not?

I love the pacing of this game. As mentioned, it seamlessly fuses different types of gameplay. In each level, players are introduced to new mechanics, which later reappear in subsequent levels. Whether it's QTE events or unique control schemes, the game teaches players to adapt to its dynamic gameplay through visual and sound effects, without the need for tutorials. However, I didn't like how the game deal with narrative. There's a narrator who talks at the start and end of the game and during key moments, like announcing your score or the name of each level. Personally, I felt that this narration somewhat broke the immersion and disrupted the flow of the experience. I believe the game is rich enough to let players experience the story on their own, without needing a narrator to explain it. That said, this is a minor complaint. Sayonara Wild Hearts is still a wonderful dream, a beautiful experience.
